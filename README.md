# BracketTree - PHP[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/agoragames/php-bracket_tree.png)](http://travis-ci.org/agoragames/php-bracket_tree) 

BracketTree is a Tree-based bracketing system designed to aid in the creation and 
representation of tournament brackets.  It uses a binary tree under the hood to
maintain the bracket, and the [BracketTree Data Specification](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree/wiki/BracketTree-Data-Specification)
to control progression and standardize representation.  This is a port of the original
[Ruby client](https://github.com/agoragames/bracket_tree).



# TODO

There's still plenty of additional functionality in the pipeline as we approach parity
with the Ruby client:

* BracketTree Template Creation (and creating brackets from a template)
* Bracket progression
* Cross-secting bracket components into sub-brackets

# Contribute

We :heart: contributions.  Do the following:

1. Fork and create feature branch.
2. Write tests and functionality.
3. Submit Pull Request.
4. Wait for a response.
